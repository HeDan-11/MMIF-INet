# MMIF-INet: Multimodal medical image fusion by invertible network
We propose a novel invertible fusion network (MMIF-INet), which directly takes multi-channel images as model inputs and performs mutual fusion of features in a process-reversible manner to preserve the information of source image pairs intact.

Please pay attention! Our method is only suitable for the fusion of color images and gray images.
