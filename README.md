# MMIF-INet: Multimodal Medical Image Fusion by Invertible Network

## Overview
MMIF-INet is a novel invertible fusion network that directly accepts multi-channel images as inputs. It performs feature fusion in a process-reversible manner, ensuring the information of the source image pairs is preserved intact. Please note that our method is specifically designed for the fusion of color and grayscale images.

==Please pay attention! Our method is only suitable for the fusion of color images and gray images.==

## Testing
To test the MMIF-INet, run the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
